    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const arr1 = players.slice();
    arr1[0] = 'hswx1';
    console.log(arr1,players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const arr2 = [].concat(players);
    arr2[0] = 'hswx2'
    console.log(arr2,players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const arr3 = [...players];
    arr3[0] = 'hswx3';
    console.log(arr3,players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'hswx',
        age: 25
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person1 = Object.assign({},person,{age: 18});
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const person2 = {...person};

    const person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person3.name = 'hswxing';
    console.log(person,person1,person3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
